# Retry Logic Implementation

## Overview

This PR adds automatic retry logic to the connection handling in our simulated integration tests. This improvement makes the tests more resilient to transient failures, which better simulates real-world scenarios.

## Changes

### Connection Retry Logic

The `Connect` method now implements a retry mechanism:

- **Maximum Retries**: 3 attempts
- **Retry Behavior**: Automatically retries on connection failure
- **Logging**: Shows retry attempts for visibility
- **Failure Reporting**: Clear error message after all retries exhausted

### Benefits

1. **Improved Reliability**: Reduces false negatives from transient failures
2. **Better Simulation**: More accurately represents real-world connection patterns
3. **Enhanced Debugging**: Clear logging of retry attempts helps identify issues
4. **Production-Ready Pattern**: Demonstrates best practices for connection handling

## Testing

To test the retry logic:

```bash
# Run with normal failure rates
go run src/main.go

# Run integration tests with failure simulation
go test -tags=integration ./tests -storage -fail -v
```

## Example Output

When a retry occurs, you'll see output like:

```
Initializing S3-like Storage service (mock)...
  Retry 1/2 connecting to S3-like Storage...
  Retry 2/2 connecting to S3-like Storage...
âœ“ Connected to S3-like Storage
```

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements for future iterations:

- Configurable retry count via environment variables
- Exponential backoff between retries
- Circuit breaker pattern for persistent failures
- Metrics collection for retry attempts
